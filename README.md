## 🏅 Olympic Skillset Analysis

This project explores the Olympic Games dataset to derive insightful visualizations and statistical summaries about athletes, events, and country-wise performance trends. Built using Python and data science libraries like **Pandas** and **Matplotlib**, this notebook reveals patterns that help understand how different factors contribute to Olympic success.

### 📊 Features

* 📁 **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and merged athlete and event datasets for accurate analysis.
* 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **Gender Participation Analysis**: Tracked male and female athlete trends over time.
* 🌍 **Country-Wise Performance**: Visualized how countries have performed historically across various events.
* 🥇 **Top Athletes**: Identified and listed top-performing athletes by medals.
* 📈 **Event Analysis**: Showed how events have evolved and which sports dominate.
* 🏋️ **Athlete Physical Traits**: Analyzed attributes like height, weight, and age distributions across sports.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Python**
* **Pandas** – for data manipulation
* **Matplotlib** – for data visualization
* **Google Colab** – development environment

### 📁 Files

* `Olympic_Skillset.ipynb`: Main notebook containing the entire analysis pipeline.
* `athlete_events.csv` and `noc_regions.csv`: Datasets used for analysis (to be added by user).

### 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Olympic-Skillset.git
   ```
2. Upload the necessary datasets (`athlete_events.csv`, `noc_regions.csv`) to the same directory.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) or locally.

### 📌 Insights

* The number of female athletes has steadily increased since the 1900s.
* USA leads the medal count historically, especially in athletics and swimming.
* Older athletes are more common in sports like equestrian and shooting, while younger athletes dominate gymnastics.
